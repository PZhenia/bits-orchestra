# WishList App

This is a CRUD application built with React and TypeScript for managing your wish list. You can add, view, edit, and delete your "wishes" — for example, for gadgets or gifts—and filter them easily by date or price. The app features a responsive modern design and works with a fake REST API (json-server).
